## Get Involved

We're just at the beginning of our journey. As we continue to develop and refine Kosmos-X, we invite you to join us. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or simply an enthusiast, your insights and contributions can help shape the future of Kosmos-X.

# Contributing to Kosmos-X

We are thrilled to invite you to be a part of the Kosmos-X project. This is not just an open source project but a community initiative, and we value your expertise and creativity. To show our appreciation, we have instituted a unique rewards system that directly compensates contributors from the revenue generated by the Kosmos-X API.

## Why Contribute

Contributing to Kosmos-X not only enhances your skills and profile but also comes with financial rewards. When you contribute code, documentation, or any form of improvement to the Kosmos-X project, you are adding value. As such, we believe it's only fair that you share in the rewards.

## Rewards Program

Here's how the Kosmos-X Rewards Program works:

1. **Submit a Pull Request:** This can be a code enhancement, bug fix, documentation update, new feature, or any improvement to the project.

2. **Review and Approval:** Our team will review your contribution. If it gets approved and merged, you become eligible for the rewards program.

3. **Revenue Share:** Once your pull request is merged, you will receive a percentage of the revenue generated by the Kosmos-X API. The percentage will be determined based on the significance and impact of your contribution. 

This means you're not just contributing to an open source project; you're becoming a part of the Kosmos-X ecosystem. Your efforts can yield ongoing benefits as the Kosmos-X API grows and evolves.

## Becoming a Paid API

As part of our growth strategy, we will be deploying Kosmos-X as a Paid API. The revenue generated from this API will not only sustain and further the project, but also fund the rewards program.
